  abstract = {We provide a primer on a hierarchical extension of the drift diffusion model (DDM). This formal model of decisions is frequently used in the cognitive sciences but infrequently used in social and personality research. Recent advances in model estimation have overcome issues that previously made the hierarchical DDM impractical to implement. Using examples from two paradigms, the first-person shooter task and the flash gambling task, we demonstrate that the hierarchical DDM can provide novel insights into cognitive processes underlying decisions. Finally, we compare the DDM to dual-process models of decision-making. We hope this primer will provide researchers a new tool for investigating psychological processes.},

  abstract = {The diffusion model for two-choice real-time decisions is applied to four psychophysical tasks. The model reveals how stimulus information guides decisions and shows how the information is processed through time to yield sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect decisions. Rapid two-choice decisions yield multiple empirical measures: response times for correct and error responses, the probabilities of correct and error responses, and a variety of interactions between accuracy and response time that depend on instructions and task difficulty. The diffusion model can explain all these aspects of the data for the four experiments we present. The model correctly accounts for error response times, something previous models have failed to do. Variability within the decision process explains how errors are made, and variability across trials correctly predicts when errors are faster than correct responses and when they are slower.},

  abstract = {The functions of the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) have recently become the target of multiple theories and empirical investigations. This region can be loosely defined as the lateral portion of Brodmann area (BA) 10. One of the challenges in testing theories about RLPFC functions is the difficulty in defining its boundaries when formulating predictions for its recruitment. Here we present a procedure that goes beyond the currently available anatomical definitions to attempt a functional localization of RLPFC. A combination of functional and anatomical criteria was employed, consistent with other localizer procedures. Functional localization was performed by comparing a relational condition involving relational matching to a control condition involving feature matching. It was expected that within an anatomically defined BA10 region, this procedure would produce functional activations in the lateral but not the medial subregions. The task was administered in the course of a single 13-min fMRI session. Results showed remarkable consistency, with all subjects activating RLPFC and activations consistently localized in the lateral part of BA10. These results demonstrate the practical feasibility of localizing RLPFC using a short procedure and a combination of functional and anatomical criteria. Such localization presents with a number of potential advantages for testing theories of RLPFC functions, including improved anatomical precision of experimental predictions, as well as the possibility of reduction in the rate of false-negative findings across studies. In addition, the results provide further support for the previously proposed functional dissociation between lateral and medial BA10.},

JAGS is intended to be modular and extensible, and modules written in the way laid out here can be loaded at runtime as needed and do not interfere with regular JAGS functionality when not loaded. Writing custom extensions requires knowledge of C++, but installing a new module can be highly automatic, depending on the operating system. As a basic example, we implement a Bernoulli distribution in JAGS. We further present our implementation of the Wiener diffusion first-passage time distribution, which is freely available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/jags-wiener/.},
